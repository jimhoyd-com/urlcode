"@jimhoyd/urlcode-store": patch
---

Collections declare `sortable` and `filterable` fields; list requests take one `sort=<field>` or `sort=-<field>` and up to three equality filters with a stable id tie-break, sorted pages use an opaque cursor that cannot repeat or skip records, and undeclared or malformed names return 400 naming only the key. Unknown query parameters on a list request now return 400 instead of being ignored. The scaffold refuses a writable mount that no access-control extension protects unless `--ack store:public-write` is passed, and writes the access model into the generated README and routes. The unordered `--with` contract is supported.
