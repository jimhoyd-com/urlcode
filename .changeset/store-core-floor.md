"@jimhoyd/urlcode-store": patch
---

The store needs a core release that has `--ack`, the unordered `--with` contract and the extension authoring contract, and its first publication peered on a core that lacks all three. This release's core peer floor is raised to the core release that has them, and release preparation and the publish preflight now refuse a floor below the core API the package uses. The README explains the unknown-option failure an older core produces.
